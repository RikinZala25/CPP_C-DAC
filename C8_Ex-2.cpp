// 2. A quadratic equation has roots. If we know the roots of the equation, we can calculate the coefficients of x^2, x and constant. Similarly, if we know the coefficients, we can find out the roots. You have two classes, 'root' and 'coeff is a(int), b(int) and c(int). Write a program to convert the objects of root class into coeff class and vice-versa. Test your program by creating objects of these classes.
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class root
{
    
};
class coeff
{

};
int main()
{

}
